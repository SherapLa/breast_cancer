#Model no 1 - Using Convolution Neural Nertwork

* Import the wiscosin dataset from the google drive
* Import necessary libraries and packages.

* Transform the target label into numeric using Encoder for better understanding of model.
* Split the dataset for training and testig.

* Buidling Convolution Neural Networks with relu as Inner activation funcion and SIgmoid as outer activation function
* Save the model.

* Complile the model with epoch rate 50.
* Predict the model with accuracy score.


#Model no 2 - Random Forest Classifier.

* Import the wiscosin dataset from the google drive.
* Import necessary libraries and packages.

* Drop the target label.
* Select the data columns which gives corelation for the ML model.
* Split the dataset into training and testing.

* Import RandomForestClassfier from sklearn ensemble module.
* Fit the model.
* Dump the model using pickle library.
